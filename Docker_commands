  ###Docker File and Commands
  #Docker file syntax consists of two kind of main line blocks: comments and commands + arguments.
  
  Ex Syntax
  #Line block used for commenting   ex:   # Print "welcome to site"
  command argument argumenta              Run echo "Welcome to the site!"
  #######################################
  #Docker Different set of commands
  1. FROM : From directive is probably the most crucial amongst all others for Dockerfiles. it defines the base image to use to start the build process. 
 ----- 
  Ex: 
  #usage: FROM [image name]
  From ubuntu  # base image and on top of it will do other functionality 
   -----
 
 2. RUN: The RUN command is the central executing directive for Dockerfiles. it takes a command as its argumetns and runs it to from the image.
         Unlike CMD, it actually is used to build the image.
     
  ----
  ex: 
  #Usage: RUN [command]
  FROM ubuntu
  RUN apt-get install -y riak
  ----
  
  3: CMD: This command CMD, similar to RUN, can be used for the executing a specific command. However, unlike 'RUN' it is not executed during the build,
          but when a container instantiated using the image being built
      
      -------
      ex: 
      #Usage 1: CMD applicaiton "argument","argument",...
      CMD "echo" "Welcome to the site"
     ----
     
     4. ENTRYPOINT: ENTRYPOINT argument sets the concrete default application that is used everytime a container is created using the image. 
      ------
      #USAGE: ENTRYPOINT application "arg","arg",...
      # Remember: arguments are optional. They can be provided by CMD
           #or during the creation of container. 
      
      ENTRYPOINT echo 
      #Usage example with CMD:
      
      #Arguments set with CMD can be overridden during *run* CMD "Hello docker!"
      CMD "Welcome to the site"
      ENTRYPOINT echo                    #this command will be overwrite previos CMD command as it is the first ENTRYPOINT command to execute. 
     --------------------
     
     5. ADD: The ADD command gets 2 arguments: a source and a destincation. basically it copies the files from the sourcer
              on the host into the containers's own filesystem at the set destination. 
              
     -------
       #USAGE: ADD {source dir or URL] [dest dir]
       ADD /my_app_folder /my_app_folder
     -----------         
     
     6. ENV: ENV command is used to set the ENV variables( one or more). These variable consists of "key and pairs". which can be accessed within the 
             container by scripts and application like 
             
    #Usage: ENV Key value
      ENV SERVER_WORKS 4 
      
      7: WORKDIR: to set where the command defined with CMD is to be executed.
        # Usage:
          WORKDIR /path WORKDIR ~/ 
       
       8: EXPOSE: It is used to associate a specified port to enable networking between the running proccess inside the container and the outside world (ie host)
          
          #USAGE: EXPOSE [port]
          EXPOSE 8080
     
     9: MAINTAINER: to add Author name to the container 
        MAINTAINER author_name 
        
     10. USER: To set UID (or username) which is to run the container based on the image being built. 
         #USAGE: USER [UID]
           USER 751
           
      11. VOLUME:  it is used to enable access from your container to a directory on the host machine (ie mounting it)
          
          #USAGE: VOLUME ["/dir_1","dir_2"..]
          VOLUME ["/myfiles"]
         
        #######CREATE an image to install APACHE Web SErver

        ENV APACHE_RUN_GROUP www-data
        ENV APACHE_LOG_DIR /var/log/apache2
